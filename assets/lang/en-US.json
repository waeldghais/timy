    "About_text":"\n No kidding, this stuff will revolutionize your life. We finally got our hands on a feature that allows you to watch several live or replay channels. \n\n Indeed, developers had the good idea to develop this application called Timytime. \n\n Concretely, it allows you to watch more than one thing You just have to choose what you want to watch. In addition it also allows you to save the date of your schedule that you want to follow it and the promised day will remind you with a notification. \n\n One of the advantages of Timytime is that the user can, with his tablet, his smartphone or his TV, access the streaming platform from any place with an Internet connection and it is for all tastes and for all ages and it is also easy to use you have nothing to configure just go to the app and log in. There is nothing more annoying than a bunch of commercials interrupting the movie or TV show you are watching. In the end, once you try Timytime, you will come to the conclusion that it really offers a fantastic experience. \nWith that, we wish you a good binge-watching!",
